- Many products are already Dockerized, but you can also create your own image and push it to **Docker Hub**.
- Traditionally, developers build applications and hand them to Ops, who face challenges setting up the environment correctly.
- With Docker, developers and Ops collaborate using a **Dockerfile** to define the setup.
- The Dockerfile creates an **image** that runs consistently on any host with Docker installed.
- This ensures reliable deployment, reduces setup errors, and supports **DevOps practices**.
