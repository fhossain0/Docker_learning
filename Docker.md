# Before understanding the docker first understand the karnel 
# Kernel in Operating Systems (OS)

A **kernel** is the **core part** of an operating system. It acts as a **bridge between hardware and software applications**. The kernel is responsible for managing critical system functions:

## Responsibilities of the Kernel

- **Memory Management**:  
  Allocates and frees memory for programs, ensuring each program has the memory it needs without interfering with others.

- **Process Management**:  
  Runs and schedules programs (processes), deciding which process gets CPU time and in what order.

- **Device Management**:  
  Controls hardware devices such as disk drives, keyboards, and printers. It ensures that software can interact with hardware safely.

- **System Calls**:  
  Provides an interface for programs to request services from the kernel, allowing safe interaction with hardware and system resources.

ðŸ’¡ **Example**:  
In Linux, the **Linux kernel** is the central part that makes your computer work, managing memory, processes, and devices efficiently.
